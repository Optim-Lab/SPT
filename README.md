# Generating High-Diversity Synthetic Tabular Data via a Less-Constrained Prior

This is the official implementation of the paper  
**"Generating High-Diversity Synthetic Tabular Data via a Less-Constrained Prior"** (IJCAI-ECAI 2026).

## 📦 Environment Setup

We recommend using a virtual environment.

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## 🔑 Weights & Biases (wandb) Setup

This codebase uses **Weights & Biases (wandb)** for experiment tracking.

1. Create a wandb account at [https://wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai)
2. Log in from the terminal:

```bash
wandb login
```

3. In `main.py` or `inference.py`, set your wandb information at the top of the file:

```python
project = "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME"
entity  = "YOUR_WANDB_USERNAME"
```

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training / Inference

This repository provides implementations of our proposed method (**SPT**) as well as baseline methods such as **CTGAN**, **TVAE**, **TabMT**, **TabDDPM**, **STaSy**, **TabSyn**, and **AutoDiff**.

The overall workflow is as follows:

1. Prepare a wandb account and configure it in the code
2. Move to the directory of the desired model (e.g., `SPT`, `TabSyn`)
3. Train the model using `main.py`
4. Generate synthetic samples using `inference.py`

---

### Step 1: Move to the Model Directory

First, navigate to the directory corresponding to the baseline or method you wish to execute. For example:

```bash
cd SPT
# or
cd baseline/TabSyn
# or
cd baseline/TabDDPM
```

---

### Step 2: Training

To train a model, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py --dataset [NAME_OF_DATASET] [ADDITIONAL_ARGS]
```

Here, `[ADDITIONAL_ARGS]` corresponds to model-specific hyperparameters, which are summarized below.

#### Required arguments by model

| Model     | Required Arguments                                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SPT**      | `dataset`, `var`, `d_token`, `denoising_dim`, `lr1`, `batch_size1`, `batch_size2`, `max_beta`                          |
| **TabSyn**   | `dataset`, `d_token`, `denoising_dim`, `lr1`, `batch_size1`, `batch_size2`, `max_beta`                                 |
| **TabDDPM**  | `dataset`, `weight_decay`, `lr`, `dim_embed`, `batch_size`, `num_layers`                                               |
| **CTGAN**    | `dataset`, `latent_dim`, `batch_size`, `epochs`, `generator_dim`, `discriminator_dim`                                  |
| **TVAE**     | `dataset`, `latent_dim`, `batch_size`, `epochs`, `loss_factor`                                                         |
| **TabMT**    | `dataset`, `dim_transformer`, `num_transformer_heads`, `num_transformer_layer`, `batch_size`, `epochs`, `max_clusters` |
| **STaSy**    | `dataset`, `model.sigma_min`, `model.sigma_max`, `optim.lr`, `model.beta0`, `model.alpha0`                             |
| **AutoDiff** | `dataset`, `d_token`, `denoising_dim`, `lr1`, `batch_size1`, `batch_size2`                                             |


#### Notes

1. Supported datasets for `--dataset` are:

```
abalone, adult, anuran, banknote, breast, concrete,
kings, letter, loan, redwine, shoppers, whitewine
```

2. To ensure reproducibility, you can fix the random seed during training by adding the `--seed` argument.

3. Below is an example command for training **SPT** on the **redwine** dataset with a fixed seed:

```bash
python main.py --dataset redwine --var 0.1 --d_token 4 --denoising_dim 1024 \
               --lr1 0.001 --batch_size1 512 --batch_size2 512 --max_beta 0.01 --seed 0
```

---
### Step 3: Inference (Synthetic Data Generation)

After training, synthetic samples can be generated using the following command:

```bash
python inference.py --dataset [NAME_OF_DATASET] [ADDITIONAL_ARGS]
```

Here, `[ADDITIONAL_ARGS]` must be **identical to those used during training**, as they are required to correctly load the trained model checkpoint.

#### Notes

1. The same set of hyperparameters used in the training phase must be provided during inference.

2. During inference, the argument `--ver` is used to specify the experiment version stored in wandb.
   * `--ver` controls which trained checkpoint is loaded and does not need to match `seed`

3. Below is an example command for generating synthetic data using **SPT** trained on the **redwine** dataset:

```bash
python inference.py --dataset redwine --var 0.1 --d_token 4 --denoising_dim 1024 \
                     --lr1 0.001 --batch_size1 512 --batch_size2 512 --max_beta 0.01 --ver 0
```

   This command loads the trained SPT model corresponding to version `ver = 0` from wandb and generates synthetic samples for the `redwine` dataset.

## ⚙ Example & Reproducibility

### Quick Start with Jupyter Notebook

We provide a comprehensive example to ensure easy reproducibility of our results.

* **File Location:** `SPT/example.ipynb`
* **Content:** This notebook contains the entire pipeline for the **anuran dataset**, including:
1. **Training:** Step-by-step model training using the SPT method.
2. **Inference:** Generating synthetic tabular data from the trained model.
3. **Evaluation:** Measuring the quality of synthetic data using all metrics (GoF, MMD, PCD, Coverage, etc.).

You can run this notebook to verify the performance and understand the workflow of our proposed method.
